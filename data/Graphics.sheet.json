They also make pulsed calls to communicate with one another. Here is a re-creation of an actual dive by southern resident orca K35, made from a recording in 2014 with a temporary acoustic tag on the whale. K35 was born in 2002 and made this dive between Hein Bank and Salmon Bank off San Juan Island. ",
